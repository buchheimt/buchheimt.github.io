After nearly 7 years of being “Tyler the (future) architect” between my time at Notre Dame and out in the real world, I found myself at a crossroads this summer. I had been testing the programming waters for around 6 months, on a whim with some very basic stuff, when the realization hit me.  I wanted this… like, **really** bad. I had no idea how realistic a career change was, I just knew that I had to try. 25 is a bit young for a mid-life crisis (*right??*), so let’s call it a preemptive strike on a future one.

I love architecture, I genuinely do, but there is something about the programming concepts I’ve been learning that appeal to me on a much deeper level. I feel engaged in an entirely different way, and I can’t seem to get enough. I was drawn to architecture because I love design and iterative problem solving. Give me a problem (or don’t, you can just mention it offhandedly), and you’ll most likely find me trying to solve it a few seconds later whether you wanted input or not. Yeah, I know, I’m working on that.

My architecture degree is highly specialized towards Classical Architecture. *“What’s the point of studying that?”* you might be wondering. Or *“Buildings don’t have columns anymore, look outside!”*. Well… you’d have a point. Life choices aside, my degree gave me an immense appreciation for what I’d call “elegant simplicity”. The idea that less can be more, and that the purest form of a design requires boiling it down to its essence.

My favorite architect, by far, was Andrea Palladio. He was responsible for designing some magnificent buildings, and to me his designs embodied this idea of elegant simplicity. My favorite building, which I was lucky enough to visit on two separate occasions while studying in Italy, will always be the [Villa Rotunda](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/07-Villa-Rotonda-Palladio.jpg). For reference, the Italian renaissance wasn’t exactly known for [subtlety](https://harrisonhartle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/chiesa-di-san-carlo-alle-quattro-fontane-barocco.jpg) . Now that second one is a favorite of mine as well, but for very different reasons. I could write an entire essay on architecture though, so I’ll just cut myself off here.

My point is that these things aren’t exclusive to architecture. Now I realize connecting problem solving to coding isn't exactly revelatory, but I also think the idea of “elegant simplicity” is extremely relevant to programming as well. The idea of taking a complex task and refining it into something sleek yet powerful, well that’s the essence of refactoring, right? There’s just something profoundly satisfying to me about taking a bulky chunk of code and refining it into a nice compact solution, all while maintaining the same (or improved!) functionality.

And that's why I'm here. I just love coding I guess.

Do I have a future in this field? I honestly don’t know. I certainly hope so! What ultimately matters to me is that by the end of my journey, one way or another, *I'll know*.
